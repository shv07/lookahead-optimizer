# lookahead-optimizer
Our work pertaining to the replication of the paper [Lookahead Optimizer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08610). It consists of application of the novel optimizer proposed in the paper for two deep learning tasks, namely classification tasks of Cifar 10 and Cifar 100 using ResNet-18 architecture.<br>
We use the the official keras codes for the ResNet-18 for this project [Link](https://keras.io/examples/cifar10_resnet/).
